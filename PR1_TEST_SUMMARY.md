# PR #1 Test Summary - Core Deployment Framework

## ✅ All Tests Passing

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 33
- **Passed**: 30
- **Skipped**: 3 (integration tests requiring network access)
- **Failed**: 0

### What's Working

1. **DeploymentToolkit Core Framework**
   - ✅ Constructor with default and custom configuration
   - ✅ SetNetwork() for mainnet, testnet, local, and custom RPC URLs
   - ✅ SetWifKey() with validation
   - ✅ GetDeployerAccount() with WIF key
   - ✅ Case-insensitive network names
   - ✅ Proper error handling for invalid inputs

2. **Network Configuration**
   - ✅ Correct RPC URLs for known networks:
     - Mainnet: https://rpc10.n3.nspcc.ru:10331
     - Testnet: http://seed2t5.neo.org:20332
     - Local: http://localhost:50012
   - ✅ Network magic retrieval framework (ready for RPC in PR 2)
   - ✅ Configuration priority: specific > global > RPC

3. **ContractDeployerService Interface**
   - ✅ IContractDeployer interface defined
   - ✅ ContractDeployerService with NotImplementedException stubs
   - ✅ Dependency injection ready

4. **Build & Package**
   - ✅ Builds successfully in Debug and Release modes
   - ✅ Creates NuGet package (Neo.SmartContract.Deploy.3.8.1.nupkg)
   - ✅ Includes symbol package (.snupkg)

### Key Features Ready for PR 2
- Framework for network magic retrieval from RPC
- Deployment options model with all necessary parameters
- Compiled contract model for NEF and manifest handling
- Deployment result models for tracking deployment info
- Proper logging infrastructure
- Async/await patterns throughout

### Notes
- All methods that will be implemented in PR 2 throw NotImplementedException
- Integration tests are skipped by default but can verify RPC connectivity
- Code follows Neo project conventions and patterns
